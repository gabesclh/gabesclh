- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel Coelho!

- 👀 I’m interested in the development of web apps, and designing brands and digital experiences. I often use Angular,
HTML/SCSS/JS, Java/Spring Boot and Wordpress in my projects.

- 🌱 I’m currently working for IBM and Itaú, as a front-end developer. I also run parallel projects of design & development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of websites, stores, web apps and more.

- 📫 You can reach me via email on gabriel@gasco.des.br, and see my portfolio on https://gasco.des.br/.
